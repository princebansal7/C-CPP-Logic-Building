# C, C++, OOPs & DSA Learning with programs

### 1. Why Should you checkout this repository ?

- To strengthen the basics of mentioned languages & Concepts I have implemented all the programs from 0 to advanced level.
- So, open the codes in sequential manner to understand "How to build logics" when making a program.

### **PS:** <math.h> in VsCode fixed 

- if **math.h** isn't working in your VsCode, use -lm flag in execution command to include libm
     
        gcc test.c -lm
            or
        gcc test.c -o test -lm
